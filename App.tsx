          <h2>About Waste Segregation</h2>
          <p>
            Waste segregation is the practice of sorting and categorizing waste
            materials into different groups based on their characteristics or
            composition. <br /> The primary goal of waste segregation is to
            facilitate the efficient management and disposal of waste while
            minimizing its environmental impact. <br /> Waste segregation is
            typically done according to the 3R principle, which stands for
            Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle.
